						<h1>The Beginning</h1>
						In early 1903 a group of 16 men met in Ben Kay’s kitchen and decided that the town of Conshohocken was in need of a second fire company.  
						Three fires, one at Judge Jim Holland’s house, one at the J. E. Lee Surgical Works, and one in Ben Kay’s kitchen on election day of 1902, convinced the men to take action.  
						On March 2, 1903, the group, now 26 in number, filed a petition for charter with the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas. 
						The request was approved by Judge H. K. Weand and on April 27, 1903 they received a written charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The fledgling fire company obtained a hose wagon, 500 feet of hose and two nozzles, which they housed in a garage in the rear of Dr. Thomas’ residence located between 6th and 7th Ave. on Fayette Street.  
						The Lee Surgical Works loaned the Company use of its horses until they could buy horses of their own. 
						Meetings were moved from the Kay’s kitchen to the cigar store of Irving Nuss, the Company’s first Vice President.  
						This move was short lived as a rapidly growing membership caused the meetings to be moved to Toner’s Hotel located where the Pizza Time Saloon now stands.  
						Sometime in 1904, the Company purchased land and moved to Ninth Ave. and Harry St. occupying a garage that was on the property.  
						On this site the Company erected what was, at that time, considered a modern and comfortable fire house with wooden floors in the wagon bays, a tin ceiling and electric light in the meeting room.  
						The “hose house”, as it was called, was dedicated in May 1906. Two horses and a new chemical hose wagon, now owned by the company, were housed here. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<h1>The 1910s & 1920s</h1>
						Ten short years later the days of the horse drawn fire wagon were over.  The membership of “TWO’S” saw the need to modernize and the first of the machines were purchased. 
						A 1916 Locomobile Chemical Combination truck and a Simplex Engine equipped with a Hale pump were placed into service by the company.  The Simplex was replaced in 1921 with a Hale White pumper.  
						In 1925 a Mort Ambulance was purchased by the company and properly equipped by the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  This was the first free ambulance service in Montgomery County.  
						A Hale Salvage truck was also purchased in 1925.  This addition caused insurance underwriters to lower premiums for residents and businesses in town.  
						It gave Conshohocken one of the best fire protection ratings and the lowest insurance rates in the state.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<h1>The 1930s & Onward</h1>
						Throughout the 1930’s the men of No.2 continued to keep the most modern of apparatus in the company’s engine room.  
						A 1933 Hale engine with a 750 gpm pump was added and in 1937 a Diamond “T” replaced the Hale salvage truck.   
						1941 saw the purchase of an Autocar pumper to replace the aging Hale White.  The “41” went on to serve the company for thirty four years, longer than any other apparatus.  
						After World War II with an apparatus fleet consisting of a 1933 Hale, a 1941 Autocar, both with 750 gpm pumps, and a 1937 Diamond “T” that had been converted into a squad truck, the men of No. 2 set out to modernize once again.  
						The Diamond “T” was replaced with a 1953 Autocar that had a state of the art three stage pump and high pressure fog nozzles.  
						Truck “J”, the Willy’s jeep was added in 1954 to carry men and equipment and in 1962 a Hahn with a Cincinnati cab replaced the ‘33 Hale.   
						The 1941 Autocar was finally replaced in 1975 by the Sanford. One of the first diesel powered 1000 gallon per minute pumpers in the county.  
						An air cascade truck was purchased in 1972 to refill airpacks on the fire scene and carry additional men and equipment. 
						It was one of the first of its kind and was called upon to assist many area fire companies over the years.  
						The purchase of two Hamerly engines was made possible in 1979 with the Borough’s cooperation and the use of urban redevelopment funds.  
						The Sanford “35-23” has been replaced by “Engine 35” a 1999 Ferrara.

						<h1>Our First Home</h1>
						The trucks were not the only thing modernized over the years.  Our building has changed with the passing of time.  
						When the Company started, the first few business meetings were held in Benjamin Kay’s house.  
						By the time the written charter had arrived from the state, meetings were being held in Nuss’ Cigar Store due to the size of the membership.  
						In 1904 the property at 9th and Harry St. was purchased.  There was a garage on the site to house the hose wagon but no meeting place.  
						Meetings were held in Toner’s Hotel until 1906 when the men completed construction of the Fire house.  
						In 1922 the company installed the Auto Call Fire Alarm Coding System to alert members when there was a fire and where the fire was located.  
						A third engine bay was added to the fire house for the ambulance which was purchased in 1925.  
						The Borough of Conshohocken installed the Gamewell Fire Alarm System in the town in 1928, and the company replaced the Auto Call System with the latest in Gamewell equipment, building the custom alarm board that still stands in the engine room today.  
						Overhead opening doors were installed and tied to the Gamewell system so they would open automatically when a fire was reported.  
						The brick sidewalk was replaced with concrete to improve the appearance of the building. 
					</p>
					<p>
						During the depression members in need of work were hired to improve the building.  The wooden floor in the engine room, which could not support the motorized apparatus, was removed.  
						A basement was dug by hand and a concrete floor was poured.  Reportedly the builders tied together bed springs, bicycle frames, car springs and whatever else they could acquire for reinforcing rods. 
						The hose tower was constructed around this time as well.  The building was expanded and remodeled again in the 1950’s.  Funds for this were raised by selling a second property the company owned.  
						The Franklin B. Thomas Hall was constructed. Many Company functions and fund raisers were hosted in this section of the building. 
						The entire outside of the structure was perma-stone coated at this time to hide the aging red brick of the original building and to give the appearance of a single structure.  
						During this remodelling the company planned to replace the concrete floor that had been installed in the 1930’s.  
						After the contractor broke several jack-hammer bits and burned up a Diamond cutting saw, the plan was abandoned and the quarry tile  was installed. 

						Engine bay doors were installed in the Thomas Hall in the 1970’s to accommodate the company’s apparatus fleet and the hall did double duty serving as a social area and an engine room until the company stopped renting the hall in the early 1980’s.  
						During the 1980’s the original part of the building was remodeled once more. New gear racks, lighting and a new ceiling were installed in the engine room. 
						The meeting room got a complete makeover.  A conference room / office was built, new heating and lighting were installed and all new carpeting and furnishings were bought.  
						The construction was financed by securing a series of grants from the state through the offices of State Senator Dick Tilghman and State Representative Lita Cohen.  
						The membership contributed to a special “Chair Fund” to purchase the furniture. Members were asked to contribute the cost of one chair until enough money was collected.  
						The names of the contributors have been recorded on a plaque which now hangs in the meeting room. 
						
						The Pleasant Valley Ambulance negotiated a lease for part of the building in the early part of the 1990’s and the hall was divided in half to provide them with space to house their ambulance and provide quarters for the crew.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<h1>Current Location</h1>
						As we celebrated our 100th year, plans were completed for what is now our fifth meeting place, our fourth engine room and our second permanent home.  
						We are now housed at 819 Fayette Street. The facility is approximately 6700 sq. ft., having a 3800 sq. ft. engine room, a driveway entering from Harry street, and the main apron exits on to Fayette Street. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<h1>Community and Members</h1>
						The membership of the company has grown and changed; keeping pace with the face of the community we protect.  
						The original membership was all male, a reflection of the society of the time.  
						During the early years of the fire company, the hose house was a source of community events.  
						Forms of entertainment were limited at that time and gathering at the fire house to play cards, pool or just exchange news was a common occurrence. 
						The fire company organized events for the general public.  The Company’s minutes contain records of dinners, dances, concerts, carnivals and other forms of entertainment hosted by the Company’s members.  
						These events were for fund raising purposes but membership was easily recruited out of fire company affairs. 
						Marching competitions at parades were a major event during the 30’s and 40’s. The Conshohocken Fire Company No.2 Uniformed Marching Club raised funds to purchase 100 uniforms for the men in 1938.  
						A veteran of World War I, Frank Hiltner, was the team’s drill instructor and twice a week practices were organized.  
						Many cash awards and trophies were won by the club during its existence and they were state champions in 1946 winning first place at the state firemen’s convention in York.   
						
					</p>
					<p>
						  Even with its diversity we are a company of families.  The company records reveal family names appearing for several generations. 
						  The regular and active membership is full of husbands and wives, mothers and fathers with sons and daughters, brothers, cousins and in-laws.  
						  The experience of the long time members continues to guide the enthusiasm of the young as parents, uncles, aunts, and older brothers passing on traditions and history to sons and daughters, nieces and nephews.  
						  We are a diversity of families coming together, united in a common cause to grow an organization that is more than a building and pieces of equipment. 
						  It is made of parts of all those who have been here through the years and it is a part of them.
